# Room-System-For-Godot
This proyect of godot contains 2 scripts that handle the room system. Then there are another scripts for the player, camera and that stuff to debug, feel free to change any code FROM YOUR ARCHIVES. Maybe this code is a little janky but I am new at coding in godot, so please give a coment if I need to fix something
